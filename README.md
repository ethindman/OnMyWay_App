# On My Way App

The "On my way" App is a project built in 3 days on the MEAN stack that allows drivers to easily send alert messages to friends and family when they are running late.

It utilizes google's traffic api and the the traffic layer to give estimates about arrival time and traffic conditions. In addition it uses gmail notifications to send out customizable messages to friends and family to give them the 411 on where you are.

Divers benefit from increased safety on the road because their alert message is only ever one click away. And friends and family don't have to worry because they know where you are and when to expect you!
